### 1.Fork a repo
Forking a repository makes a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. The parent repository is referred to as the upstream while your forked copy is referred to as the origin. Once you've forked a repository into your GitHub account you can clone it to your local machine. Forking allows you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository
